He is only trouble yes I know
But I feel so fatalistic
Got a thousand ways to show it
Shoes and my lipstick

I'm gonna let you know
Just who I am
Gonna make you realize
Gonna make you understand
Want ya to do just what I want ya to
Come on baby
Do you need me
Like I need you
Like I need you
Like I need you

Cause I
I've seen your plans
Like your games
You wanna play like that
I could do that same
Cause if I ever catch you fooling around
I'm gonna send ya back
To where I found ya
To your mamma and your sisters too

Come on baby
Do you need me
Like I need you Tell me true

And now, you come around late at night
To dance away your worries
Sayin' you got me on your mind
Ain't gonna waste my time

I'm gonna let you know
Just who I am
Gonna make you realize
Gonna make you understand
Want ya to do just what I want ya to
Come on baby
Do you need me
Like I need you
Like I need you
Like I need you
