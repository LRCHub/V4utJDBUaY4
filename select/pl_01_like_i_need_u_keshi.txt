Baby,
I call in the dead of night
But you don't need me like
I need you
Pray that I won't be alone
Baby,
I call in the dead of night
But you don't need me like
I need you
Pray that I won't be alone
Layin' on the bed
Waitin' for your text
Babe, there's nothin' left
Faded I'm a wreck
Afraid what's coming next
Wished we never met
Laying us to rest but
Baby, I beg you
Too soon with a drunk call
In the middle of the night you
Took it, my fault
Didn't really mean to interrupt
But if you change your mind then
hit me up
Pain, that's an option
No time for nonsense
Can't ask you nothing
Drank, feeling nauseous
Too many toxins
Not even conscious
Say nothin' more
Say nothin' more, baby
Pain, that's an option
No time for nonsense
Can't ask you nothing
Drank, feeling nauseous
Too many toxins
Not even conscious
Say nothin' more
Say nothin' more, baby
We're better on our own
Tonight I'm getting throwed
She never coming home
Stay with me
Say you'll leave
Pain, that's an option
No time for nonsense
Can't ask you nothing
Drank, feeling nauseous
Too many toxins
Not even conscious
Say nothin' more
Say nothin' more, baby
Pain, that's an option
No time for nonsense
Can't ask you nothing
Drank, feeling nauseous
Too many toxins
Not even conscious
Say nothin' more
Say nothin' more, baby
Baby girl, it's saying
That we just friends, that we
just friends
If we fucking are we just
friends
Are we just friends?
