In the closest alley
In the first doorway
He pushed up against her
And closed his eyes

He said this is probably
The worst decision that I've ever made
She laughed and smiled, and said I'm sure you do this all the time
Right, right, right, right, right?

And the morning came and the city awoke
And in the building, people all went to work
As their out of town rides came, they parted ways
She said, do you know when you're coming back again?

Dig it deeper, deeper and farther still
Bury it up and over and into the ground
All these lies will grow in ways
That we never thought possible

Quiet down, down, down, it's so soft of a sound
You can hear it all coming back after you
Quiet down, down, down, it's so soft of a sound
You can hear it all coming back after you

Now you want to take it back, you think you might have fucked up
Waking dreams of concrete, deafening panic, cracked skull
There's yelling all around
Get up, get up, please start breathing

And the moment will come when you finally realize
The results of decisions and choices in your life
Can you hear it all coming back after you?

Down, down, down, it's so soft of a sound
You can hear it all coming back after you
Quiet down, down, down, it's so soft of a sound
You can hear it all coming back after you
