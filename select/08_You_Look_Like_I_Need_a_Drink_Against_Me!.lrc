[00:22.63] In the closest alley
[00:25.38] In the first doorway
[00:28.28] He pushed up against her
[00:31.55] And closed his eyes
[00:41.05] 
[00:34.86] He said this is probably
[00:37.96] The worst decision that I've ever made
[00:41.15] She laughed and smiled, and said I'm sure you do this all the time
[00:46.76] Right, right, right, right, right?
[01:03.76] 
[01:01.72] And the morning came and the city awoke
[01:03.09] And in the building, people all went to work
[01:04.63] As their out of town rides came, they parted ways
[01:06.26] She said, do you know when you're coming back again?
[01:32.26] 
[01:07.95] Dig it deeper, deeper and farther still
[01:09.58] Bury it up and over and into the ground
[01:11.43] All these lies will grow in ways
[01:12.93] That we never thought possible
[01:27.93] 
[01:17.44] Quiet down, down, down, it's so soft of a sound
[01:21.11] You can hear it all coming back after you
[01:24.39] Quiet down, down, down, it's so soft of a sound
[01:27.68] You can hear it all coming back after you
[01:48.18] 
[01:31.13] Now you want to take it back, you think you might have fucked up
[01:32.84] Waking dreams of concrete, deafening panic, cracked skull
[01:34.52] There's yelling all around
[01:35.51] Get up, get up, please start breathing
[01:54.51] 
[01:38.09] And the moment will come when you finally realize
[01:39.51] The results of decisions and choices in your life
[01:41.33] Can you hear it all coming back after you?
[02:02.33] 
[01:44.67] Down, down, down, it's so soft of a sound
[01:48.15] You can hear it all coming back after you
[01:51.53] Quiet down, down, down, it's so soft of a sound
[01:54.92] You can hear it all coming back after you
